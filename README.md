Ball color prediction using machine learning involves training a model to predict a ball's color based on input features like size, weight, or texture. 
The process includes collecting labeled data, preprocessing it to ensure accuracy, 
selecting relevant features, and training algorithms like decision trees or neural networks to recognize patterns.
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision before deployment for real-time predictions. 
This approach is useful in applications like quality control and automation, offering a data-driven solution for efficient decision-making.
